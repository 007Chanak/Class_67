Pain was planning to get the nine tales from naruto after killing jiraya. 
After a few days pain arrived in konoha and started destroying the village. 
Once, the village was destroyed and sakura was badly injured and kakashi was dead. 
Later sakura screamed "Naruto!!!". 
Then naruto appaered with giants toads to fight pain with his new power "Toad Sage Mode". 
After battling  pain, Naruto talks to pain why he wants to capture him and what will happen next.
Pain replied "Peace, by making a weapon to kill all of Shinobi kind". 
Then Naruto did not accept this and used his most powerful jutsu called "Talk-no jutsu". 
After listening to what Naruto said, Pain revived all of the Konoha Shinobi he killed. 
After that moment Naruto became a Hero in the village.
